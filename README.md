# Exploring Insights From Synthetic Airline Data Analysis With Qlik

## Overview

This project aims to explore and analyze synthetic airline data using Qlik Sense, a powerful data visualization and business intelligence tool. The dataset simulates various aspects of airline operations, including flight schedules, passenger demographics, ticket sales, and performance metrics. The objective is to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations within the data to support strategic decision-making processes for airlines, airports, and related stakeholders.

## Project Objectives

The project is structured around three main objectives:

1. **Revenue Optimization**
   - Analyze historical ticket sales data to identify peak travel times, popular destinations, and effective pricing strategies.
   - Segment customers based on purchasing behavior to tailor marketing strategies and maximize profitability.

2. **Operational Efficiency**
   - Examine flight schedules, passenger flows, and luggage handling processes to enhance operational efficiency.
   - Identify bottlenecks in airport operations and propose strategies to optimize resource allocation.

3. **Customer Experience Enhancement**
   - Perform sentiment analysis on customer feedback to identify areas for service improvement.
   - Develop personalized offerings and targeted marketing campaigns to improve customer satisfaction and loyalty.

## Methodology

The analysis was conducted using Qlik Sense, following these key steps:

1. **Data Ingestion:** Loading and preparing the synthetic airline dataset in Qlik Sense.
2. **Data Exploration:** Utilizing Qlikâ€™s associative model to explore relationships between different data fields.
3. **Data Cleaning:** Modifying and enhancing the dataset to include additional fields for a more in-depth analysis.
4. **Visualization:** Creating interactive dashboards to visualize key insights.
5. **Analysis:** Interpreting the visual data to derive actionable insights and recommendations.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset is a synthetic representation of airline operations, providing a rich and comprehensive view of various aspects, from passenger demographics to flight performance. The original dataset includes fields such as:

- Passenger ID
- First Name
- Last Name
- Gender
- Age
- Nationality
- Airport Name
- Airport Country Code
- Country Name
- Airport Continent
- Continents
- Departure Date
- Arrival Airport
- Pilot Name
- Flight Status

After data cleaning, additional fields were added to enhance the analysis, including:

- Nationality GeoInfo
- Airport Country Code GeoInfo
- Country Name GeoInfo
- Age Group
- Year (extracted from Departure Date)
- Month (extracted from Departure Date)

## Key Findings

### Revenue Optimization
- High-demand travel periods and top destinations were identified, allowing for more targeted pricing strategies.
- Customer segments based on purchasing behavior provided insights for more effective marketing campaigns.

### Operational Efficiency
